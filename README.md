# **Flood Graph Project**
##### **Spatio-Temporal Graph Modeling and Prediction of Rainfall and Inflow Patterns**

## **🔍 Objective**
Flood prediction is a major climate-risk challenge globally.
This project builds a spatio-temporal ML pipeline to predict next-day river inflow using:

✔ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial-temporal learning
✔ RandomForest baseline for benchmarking
✔ Interactive Streamlit dashboard
✔ Real rainfall geospatial grid data

Forecasting horizon: +1 day ahead inflow
Data granularity: Latitude × Longitude rainfall grid per day

## **Dataset Description**
data/newflood.xlsx contains two sheets:

#### **1. Sheet 1 – Rainfall Grid**
* First row -> Latitude values
* Second row -> Longitude values
* Subsequent rows -> year, month, day, intensity grid
* Each cell (lat, lon) represents rainfall intensity on that date.

#### **2. Sheet 2 – Inflow Data**
* Columns: Date, Inflow (cumecs)
* Used as target variable for prediction and correlation analysis.

## **Example Workflow**
Run the entire pipeline:

_python main.py_

This will:
* Load and preprocess both sheets from data/newflood.xlsx
* Perform spatio-temporal clustering
* Build a rainfall graph
* Train a RandomForest model for inflow prediction
* Train a GNN for spatio-temporal forecasting (optional)
* Give evaluation metrics and plots

## **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**
The GNN uses PyTorch Geometric to model spatio-temporal dependencies between rainfall locations.
It learns how rainfall at connected locations propagates to influence inflow intensity over time.

### **Architecture**
* GraphConv -> ReLU -> Dropout -> Linear
* Edge weights are based on spatial proximity or correlation.
* Optimized with MSELoss for inflow prediction.

### **Evaluation Metrics**
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* R² Score

Run GNN training:

_python main.py --gnn_

## **Visualization Samples**
* Spatio-Temporal Clusters
* Graph Connectivity
* Prediction Comparison

## **Requirements**
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt

Install them using:

_pip install -r requirements.txt_

## Research Relevance
This project is aligned with Climate Informatics, Data-Driven Hydrology, and Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning research.

Potential research directions:
* Graph Neural Networks for rainfall–runoff modeling
* Cluster-based hydrological forecasting
* Transfer learning for regional flood prediction
* Uncertainty quantification in graph-based predictions
